# Modelica2020Asia
Contains the Modelica and Orcaflex simulation files for results discussed in the paper titled 'Simulating the Dynamics of a Chain Suspended Sub-sea Load Using Modified Components from the Modelica MultiBody Library.'

For simulating the various scenarios discussed in the paper in Modelica, open the LMC_MBS_V0.mo file in OMEdit (or similar), and change parameters Hr,Tr,zcg[:],Uf[:] in the Dnb component model, as required.

For simulating the various secnarios discussed in the paper in Orcaflex, open the Suspended_Subsea_Load.sim  simulation file (this requires the user to have an Orcaflex license), and change the environment parameters accordingly.
