# Modelica2020Asia
Contains the Modelica and Orcaflex simulation files for results discussed in the paper titled Modelica Component Model for Suspended Subsea Loads.

For simulating the various scenarios discussed in the paper in Modelica, open the LMC_MBS_V0.mo file in OMEdit (or similar) and change parameters Hr,Tr,zcg[:],Uf[:] in the Dnb component model.

For simulating the various secnarios discussed in the paper in Orcaflex, open the Suspended_Subsea_Load.sim  simulation file (this requires the user to have an Orcaflex license), and change the environment parameters accordingly.
